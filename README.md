# Handling Missing Values 🔍

## Overview
A Python script that provides an interactive solution for handling missing values in datasets. This tool is designed for data preprocessing and cleaning, offering multiple imputation methods through a user-friendly command-line interface.

## 🌟 Features
- **Interactive Data Loading**: Load your CSV files and select specific columns for processing
- **Missing Value Analysis**: View missing value counts in your selected columns
- **Multiple Imputation Methods**:
  - Statistical Methods:
    - Mean imputation
    - Mode imputation
    - Median imputation
  - Advanced Methods:
    - Random value imputation
    - Missing value flagging
    - Row deletion
    - Grouped mean imputation
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation
    - Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
```
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
```

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Utkarsh-152/Handling-Missing-values.git
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## 💻 Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Handling-Missing-values
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python missing_values_handler.py
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Provide the path to your CSV file
   - Select columns you want to process
   - Choose your preferred imputation method

## 🔧 Available Methods

1. **Mean Imputation**
   - Fills missing values with column mean
   - Best for numerical data with normal distribution

2. **Mode Imputation**
   - Fills missing values with most frequent value
   - Suitable for categorical data

3. **Median Imputation**
   - Fills missing values with column median
   - Good for numerical data with outliers

4. **Random Imputation**
   - Replaces missing values with random existing values
   - Maintains data distribution

5. **Missing Flag**
   - Marks missing values as "Missing"
   - Useful for tracking missing data

6. **Row Deletion**
   - Removes rows with missing values
   - Use when data completeness is crucial

7. **Grouped Fill**
   - Fills based on group means
   - Perfect for data with meaningful groupings

8. **KNN Imputation**
   - Uses similar data points for imputation
   - Good for maintaining data relationships

9. **MICE**
   - Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations
   - Best for complex missing data patterns

## 📝 Example Output
```
Available columns:
['column1', 'column2', 'column3']

The missing values in the selected columns are:
column1    5
column2    3
column3    7

Choose how you want to fill your null values:
1: Mean
2: Mode
3: Median
...
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
# Sample code execution
Enter the file path: data.csv
Enter column names separated by commas: age,income,education
Choose imputation method: 1
```
